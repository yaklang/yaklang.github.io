  "电子科技大学网络空间安全研究院描述": "The Institute for Cyber Security of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China is one of the earliest institutes in China to systematically carry out research on computer systems and cyber security. It innovatively puts forward an Active Cyber-security Model with \"Intelligence\", \"Analysis\" and \"Liveliness\" as its core elements, and continues to carry out basic and pioneering exploration and practice in this field.. It has taken the lead in winning the first prize for the National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2019 and the second prize for the National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2012. It was the 3-time winner of the first prize for provincial and ministerial Science and Technology Progress Award and 2-time winner of the first prize for provincial and ministerial Technological Invention. It was selected as the outstanding achievement of projects supported by the 13th Five-Year Plan National Natural Science Foundation. 400 high-level academic papers and many books have been published. CDSL-YAK is the first domestic open-source domain-specific language in the field of cyber security</span>, which was initiated by the core members of \"Cohesion Studio\" founded by the Institute for Cyber Security and has developed for many years.
